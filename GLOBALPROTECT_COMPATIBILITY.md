# GlobalProtect compatibility evidence

**GlobalProtect lifecycle compatibility unverified across login/reboot and
management policies.** An authorized live stop/restore cycle passed on the
specific configuration recorded below, including a subsequent Connected status. The
self-check alone provides read-only installation/state evidence and does not
establish lifecycle or VPN connectivity results.

The current Keep Off and in-app GlobalProtect Quit All implementation includes an explicitly authorized stop of
the fixed system VPN service. Earlier read-only evidence below predates this
behavior. Automated full-stop/restore fixtures do not establish live VPN,
login/reboot, or managed-policy compatibility. See the separate
[September 28 live test](Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-09-28-live-stop-restore.md)
for the exercised behavior, exact binaries, and limitations.

The later [passwordless restoration test](Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-09-28-passwordless.md)
verifies Open and Keep Off without repeated administrator prompts on that
session-agent installation. The separate system daemon remains disabled;
Open no longer re-enables a service that the session restoration path does not
use. System-only layouts retain the administrator path.

Current regression fixtures also cover preservation of a loaded system daemon
and its override on session layouts (reported as an incomplete Keep Off),
background preservation of `pangps`, delayed daemon shutdown, readiness
deadlines, failed restoration intent, and polling cancellation. These changes
have no new live lifecycle evidence. View regression tests also verify that
Quit App / Quit Helpers confirmations and the Settings dry run list only
`pangpa` for unloading, and that per-user protected processes show Services.

Quit All now uses the full Keep Off path. Normal full stops press the vendor's
Disconnect control through Accessibility and require a stable idle
state before changing launch jobs: Not Connected, or Error accompanied by
Connection Failed, an enabled Connect control, and no Disconnect control in
the same vendor window. The UI adapter currently recognizes the
English status/control labels; unsupported layouts or states fail without
stopping services. Ordinary Quit and Shortcuts Stop can unload only the `pangpa`
interface agent and preserve the session VPN service and system daemon.
Shortcuts Stop requests confirmation naming the watched app before executing,
including when invoked through Siri, Spotlight, or App Shortcuts.
After a failed attempt, **Stop Services Anyway…** offers a separately confirmed
exception that skips the idle-state prerequisite, discloses stale-DNS risk, and
uses the same fixed service controls. The [October 1 recovery check](Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-10-01-disconnect-recovery.md)
verifies failure/result visibility, cancellation, and the confirmed recovery
with an unresponsive vendor UI on the recorded configuration.
The [automatic Quit All test](Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-09-28-quit-all.md)
records two connected-to-off cycles with public HTTPS working afterward and
the final installed build's unchanged menu-bar frame.

The [restore regression follow-up](Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-09-29-restore.md)
records the enabled-but-unloaded service failure and duplicate UI, the fix that
makes toggle-off perform a complete restoration, final live checks, and the
remaining limits of the orphan-recovery validation.

The [menu-bar Quit All follow-up](Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-09-29-menu-quit-all.md)
covers persistent progress/results and full shutdown from the vendor's failed
connection view. It does not establish that an unreachable VPN portal can connect.

On the tested 6.3.3-1121 layout, the GUI-session `pangps` job runs a setuid
PanGPS process as root. A root process therefore does not by itself establish
that `pangpsd` is running. When the session agent is installed, Open restores
that service and verifies its launchd PID and executable; only layouts without
it use TaskScope's system-daemon restoration path. A loaded system daemon on a
session layout is preserved during Keep Off, including its existing override;
the session plist alone does not establish that the system daemon is unused.
The vendor also documents a related
[daemon-to-session-agent startup failure](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/release-notes/6-3/globalprotect-addressed-issues/globalprotect-6-3-3-h9-windows-and-macos-addressed-issues)
when pre-logon is disabled. This reference does not establish that every vendor
build shares the same bug or behavior.

The built-in preset cannot be deleted while Keep Off is enabled, an explicit
Keep Off action is queued/running, or settings are unreadable: a fallback `false`
cannot prove overrides cleared. Stale confirmation or removal during disconnect
is rejected before writing intent or overrides. Recover settings and clear Keep
Off before deletion. Unreadable settings also disable Quit All, Apply Keep Off,
the Keep Off switch, and Stop Services Anyway with a reset-settings explanation.

Main/helper status, Open readiness, and direct preset stops require current-user
ownership. Another logged-in user's GlobalProtect UI or PanGPA helper does not
trigger Keep Off enforcement. Preserved PanGPS alone does not trigger polling
stops, and unchanged background failures are not repeatedly reported. Protected
names remain classified for display; automatic disconnect and final Keep Off
instead require attribution to this user's `pangps` or system `pangpsd` job via
launchd PID, ownership, and kernel executable path. Unknown attribution fails
without opening vendor UI. These boundaries have fake-runtime coverage; Fast
User Switching and vendor UI routing between sessions remain unverified.
See [GlobalProtect behavior](docs/GLOBALPROTECT.md) for action and recovery details.

## Evidence collected

| Kind / date | macOS / architecture | GlobalProtect / TaskScope | Result | Limits |

Other layouts, policy, login/reboot and private resources untested |
| Menu-bar Quit All, 2026-09-29 UTC | 26.6.2 (25G83), arm64 | GlobalProtect 6.3.3-1121; TaskScope executable `81e7ae1f…` | [Follow-up](Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-09-29-menu-quit-all.md): two final menu-bar full stops from Connection Failed; visible progress and one result sheet; zero vendor processes; Open restored one UI and service; public HTTPS 200 | Portal connection attempts reported unreachable/unresponsive, so no new connected-to-off cycle; translated UI, other layouts, policy and reboot untested |

The September 12 live report describes the recorded environment's existing state. The check did not create
that state and no repair was attempted. In particular, the absent protected
daemon is a coverage gap, not a successful protected-service validation. The
observation used Swift 6.3.3 and Xcode 26.6 (17F113). The test runner's own bundle
version is deliberately excluded from the TaskScope version fields.

Historical automated checks for the September 12 implementation passed on the
recorded macOS/toolchain, including focused fixtures, a separate read-only probe,
strict tests, release build, packaging, and shell syntax. These results apply to
that revision; they do not replace untested lifecycle steps or validate later
source changes. Current release candidates must run the [release gate](RELEASE.md).

macOS 14/15, other macOS releases, Intel, other GlobalProtect versions, and other
installed layouts remain untested for this feature. An arm64 process value
describes the running executable; it is not a hardware inventory or proof of
universal binary support.

## Repeatable read-only collection

1. Use the bundled app's **Compatibility Self-Check** on the GlobalProtect
   preset, or **Settings > Watched Apps > GlobalProtect**. Wait for the report.
2. Review all fields, including unknown states. Use **Refresh** after the state
   you intended to observe has settled; probes are not an atomic transaction.
3. Choose **Copy Summary** or **Export…** and retain the exact redacted text.
   Add the release/source revision and signing/install method separately.
4. Record the evidence kind as **live read-only observation**. Do not turn a
   snapshot into a pass/fail claim about actions that were never exercised.

The opt-in developer probe uses the same collector without reading app
preferences or performing lifecycle actions:

```bash
TASKSCOPE_LIVE_COMPATIBILITY=1 swift test \
  --filter GlobalProtectCompatibilityTests/testLiveReadOnlyEvidenceWhenExplicitlyRequested
```

Only the text between the report heading and its final manual-check reminder
is the redacted summary. The surrounding Swift build/test log can contain local
checkout paths; do not attach that raw log publicly. By default, the live test
is skipped so fixtures do not depend on any installed GlobalProtect version.

## Authorized lifecycle evidence

On a managed test machine approved for these operations, record a separate row
per macOS build, CPU architecture, GlobalProtect version/layout, and TaskScope
artifact/revision. Retain the baseline and each after-action self-check export.

| Step | Evidence to record |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline | Installed known agents, explicit overrides or plist defaults, loaded state, process counts, protected-service state |
| Enable Keep Off | Confirmation and actual lifecycle result; known jobs disabled/unloaded or failures explained. On session layouts a loaded system daemon and its override must remain unchanged, with an incomplete-stop result |
| Relaunch TaskScope | Actual result and new report; distinguish preserved intent from observed launchd state |
| Log out/in or reboot | Which event occurred, user-agent/process state afterward, management software interference, and new report |
| Turn Keep Off off | Full Open restoration: required overrides cleared, VPN service and one UI running; unused system daemon stays disabled on session-agent installations |
| Choose Open | Actual user-agent restoration, app result, any administrator request/result for an absent protected daemon, and report |
| Protected service / VPN | Compare baseline and later system state; verify connectivity through the organization's supported method separately |

Record **pass**, **fail**, or **not tested** for each performed step, with the
observed result and redacted artifact references. Only the explicitly approved Keep Off or GlobalProtect Quit All action may unload the fixed system
daemon on daemon-only layouts. Record its absence after stopping and verified identity after Open;
on session layouts, record preservation of any loaded system daemon and its override;
never directly signal it or restart a loaded daemon just to obtain evidence. System-state changes may be
caused by policy or other software; the self-check cannot attribute causation.

## Machine-checkable release evidence

`script/release.sh --preflight` and `--release` require authorized lifecycle
evidence before checking signing credentials or building a public binary.
**The existing fixtures and live read-only report do not satisfy this gate.**
There is currently no qualifying lifecycle manifest, so public-binary preflight
fails. Source/development packaging remains available and must retain the
**GlobalProtect lifecycle compatibility unverified** notice.

For a candidate with `VERSION=V` and `BUILD_NUMBER=B`, retain one plain UTF-8
`*.evidence` file per claimed macOS build / architecture / GlobalProtect version
and agent layout under `Evidence/GlobalProtect/lifecycle/V-B/`. All manifests
in that directory must pass; at least one is required. These files define the
tested combinations, not a claim for other macOS releases or product versions.
Use a separate manifest for each persistence event if claiming both logout/login
and reboot coverage.

Each record is a literal `key=value` line. Values are case-sensitive, nonempty,
and contain no whitespace. Empty or whitespace-only lines and lines beginning
with `#` are allowed; indented comments are not. Use LF line endings and UTF-8
without a BOM. CRLF and leading BOMs fail with explicit diagnostics.
Duplicate or unknown keys, malformed lines, missing fields, and unsupported
schema versions fail. These are data files; they are never sourced as shell
code. There is no environment override or skip switch for this gate.

| Required field | Accepted value / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Exactly `1` |
| `evidence_kind` | Exactly `authorized-lifecycle`; this attests that the managed test machine was approved for these operations |
| `test_date` | Test date in `YYYY-MM-DD` syntax |
| `taskscope_version`, `taskscope_build` | Exact candidate `VERSION` and `BUILD_NUMBER` |
| `source_revision` | Full 40-character lowercase Git commit SHA, present locally and an ancestor of `HEAD` (or `HEAD` itself) |
| `bundle_id` | Exact `TASKSCOPE_BUNDLE_ID` supplied to the release script |
| `signing_kind` | `ad-hoc`, `apple-development`, or `developer-id`, as observed on the tested bundle |
| `install_method` | `staged-bundle`, `local-install`, or `downloaded-archive` |
| `macos_version`, `macos_build` | Numeric version such as `26.6.2`, and Apple build identifier such as `25G83` |
| `architecture` | Exactly `arm64`, matching the current release policy |
| `globalprotect_version` | Two to four numeric version components, optionally followed by a numeric hyphen suffix, e.g. `6.3.3-1121`; retain the suffix when present |
| `agent_layout` | `pangpa-only` or `pangpa-and-pangps`, from installed known agents |
| `persistence_event` | `logout-login` or `reboot`, whichever was actually performed |
| `coverage_gaps` | Exactly `none`; unknown probes, unexpected labels, unverified protected service, policy interference, or skipped checks prevent a pass |
| `manual_results` | Path to the redacted manual observations described below |
| `result_<step>` | Exactly `pass` for **each** of the nine steps below; `fail`, `not-tested`, `unknown`, and every other value block release |
| `report_<step>` | A distinct retained self-check export path for **each** of the first six steps below |

The nine exact step names are `baseline`, `keep_off`, `relaunch`, `persistence`,
`keep_off_disabled`, `open`, `protected_service`, `vpn`, and `managed_policy`.
The first six correspond to baseline and the five after-action exports in the
authorized lifecycle procedure. `keep_off_disabled` records turning Keep Off off
through the full Open restoration, including the required service and app launch.
`protected_service` records the baseline/later comparison and verified identity; `vpn` records restoration checked through the
organization's supported method; `managed_policy` records whether management
interfered throughout the sequence. Absence is required after Keep Off; a verified running service in the
installed launchd domain is required at baseline and after Open.

All referenced paths are repository-relative and must stay inside the same
`Evidence/GlobalProtect/lifecycle/V-B/` directory. Paths may contain only ASCII
letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, and `/`, starting with a letter or digit; absolute
paths, `.`/`..` path components, doubled slashes, and symlinks (including parent
directories) are rejected. Every manifest and referenced artifact must be a
readable, nonempty regular file tracked by Git. Review/redact and `git add` new
evidence before preflight; the full release additionally requires a clean
worktree. Keep exports unchanged after redaction review and record observed
outcomes, signing/install details, administrator requests/results, and all nine
manual checks in `manual_results`. Do not retain raw tool logs or private VPN
configuration.

The candidate's tracked content must match `source_revision`, including staged
and unstaged changes, except for `Evidence/GlobalProtect/`,
`GLOBALPROTECT_COMPATIBILITY.md`, `RELEASE.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. This allows
evidence and its documentation to be committed after testing without a circular
commit SHA. Any other content change requires a new tested revision. Preflight
does not replace the full release's clean-worktree check.

This deliberately incomplete template illustrates all required fields for the
current candidate. Replace the placeholders and every `not-tested` only after
collecting the corresponding evidence; copying it unchanged must fail:

report_keep_off_disabled=Evidence/GlobalProtect/lifecycle/1.0.0-3/environment/keep-off-disabled.txt
report_open=Evidence/GlobalProtect/lifecycle/1.0.0-3/environment/open.txt
```

Place the manifest itself directly in `1.0.0-3/`, for example
`environment.evidence`; referenced artifacts may use subdirectories. Update the
human evidence matrix and release notes to match the actual tested combinations.
The gate validates the manifest, source binding, and presence of retained files.
It does **not** interpret export contents, authenticate manual attestations,
exercise lifecycle actions, or certify VPN health. Reviewers must compare each
export and manual observation with the recorded results. A passing manifest for
an ad-hoc test bundle does not establish Developer ID or downloaded-binary QA.

## Interpretation and privacy

- `pangpa` is the required known user agent; `pangps` is optional. Missing an
  optional plist alone is not an incompatibility. A loaded job or persistent
  override can survive removal of a plist, so all three states are independent.
- Explicit enabled/disabled overrides differ from **No override**. The latter
  defers to the installed plist's `Disabled` default. If the plist is missing,
  unreadable, or has a different label, that effective default is unverified.
- Failed, denied, timed-out, cancelled, or unrecognized reads are unknown, never
  evidence of absence. launchctl text is not a stable API; retain unknown
  results as gaps when macOS output changes.
- Current-user `PanGPS` is distinct from root `PanGPS`. Root ownership alone is
  insufficient to verify the protected system job: its PID and a kernel path
  within the known product directories must also match. This is an observation
  of identity/path, not signature validation or a service-health check.
- Only fixed public job labels, bounded version metadata, time, states, and
  process counts enter the report. Raw plist/launchd output, private process
  details, organization configuration, and network contents are not exported.
  Additional/relocated agents can be missed; the report is not a discovery of
  every vendor component installed on the Mac.

Review before sharing. Nothing uploads automatically. Remove exported files
and replace clipboard contents when finished. See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for
collection/recovery and [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for the compatibility claim gate.
