# TaskScope Threat Model

This document describes TaskScope's security boundaries and the invariants that
must remain true as the app evolves. It is a design and review aid, not a claim
that a particular artifact is signed, notarized, sandboxed, or vulnerability
free. Update it whenever process actions, lifecycle jobs, automation,
persistence, permissions, or distribution change.

## Scope

In scope:

- local process discovery, display, selection, and signaling;
- auto-stop rules and saved selections;
- watched-app presets, imports, and lifecycle actions;
- custom user launch-agent jobs and the immutable built-in GlobalProtect
  system-daemon stop and restoration paths;
- custom URLs, App Intents/Shortcuts, login items, and notifications;
- preferences, recovery backups, local logs, and preset exports;
- bundle identity, local packaging, signing, installation, and upgrades.

The security of macOS, Xcode, SwiftPM, Apple signing/notarization services,
GlobalProtect, and other managed applications is outside TaskScope's direct
control. TaskScope must nevertheless fail safely when those dependencies are
missing, denied, or return unexpected data.

## Assets and security goals

TaskScope should protect:

- **Process integrity:** signal only the process identity the user reviewed or a
  rule captured, never a recycled PID or a different queued target.
- **System availability:** make destructive actions explicit, keep protected
  processes out of ordinary stop paths, and never target TaskScope itself.
- **Privilege boundaries:** request administrator approval only for visible
  stop or restoration of the fixed daemon in the immutable built-in GlobalProtect
  definition; never let a custom preset add privileged behavior, retain
  credentials, or bypass authorization.
- **Configuration integrity:** validate imported and persisted lifecycle fields,
  preserve unreadable data, and avoid reporting unsaved mutations as durable.
- **Local privacy:** do not transmit process or organization data, and minimize
  its appearance in exports, notifications, and logs.
- **Release integrity:** never represent an ad-hoc or development-signed bundle
  as Developer ID-signed, notarized, universal, or broadly runtime-tested.

## Actors and assumptions

- The interactive macOS user is trusted to approve a clearly described process
  or lifecycle action.
- A preset file, custom URL, process name, process output, local preference, and
  other same-user application are untrusted inputs.
- A same-user local adversary may open a custom URL, alter an exported preset,
  race process exit/PID reuse, or edit preferences. TaskScope should prevent
  those inputs from silently becoming a different destructive action.
- A system administrator controls authorization policy, protected services,
  managed application versions, and writable install locations.
- Malware already running with the user's or administrator's authority is not
  fully contained by this utility; macOS authorization remains the final
  boundary for privileged operations.

## Trust boundaries and required invariants

### Process inventory to signal delivery

TaskScope reads process data through local macOS tools. PIDs are reusable and a
displayed row can become stale at any suspension point.

Required invariants:

- operate only on visible processes and signal only where macOS permits;
- capture a process identity, including start evidence and the kernel-resolved
  executable path when available, before confirmation;
- re-read and compare identity immediately before sending a signal; start-time
  evidence uses UTC to survive time-zone changes. Executable paths remain part
  of equality because start-time evidence has only second precision;
- distinguish “not present,” “identity changed,” and “could not verify”;
  a present PID with changed start or executable evidence is identity-changed;
  a still-running PID/start pair with a moved or unavailable executable path
  must not produce an Auto Stop Ended or Stopped event. A row reported as
  `<defunct>` with no kernel executable path is already exited and must not be
  signalled; a missing path alone does not establish exit;
- never turn an unreadable inventory into a success or stale-target claim;
- distinguish unobserved watched status from a verified quiet observation, mark
  retained observations stale after failures, and resolve preset card actions
  against current configuration;
- measure shared inventory cache age and ordering with monotonic time including
  sleep; expire negative ages and use uncached inventory for destructive checks;
- retry shell child reaping after early exit notifications or stop requests
  until reaped, including after command timeout;
- judge preset Quit and Close against the captured preset and fresh final
  inventory even if the stored preset changes or is deleted;
- partial stop failures must not claim every target stopped or no target
  received a stop request;
- never signal TaskScope itself, launchd (pid 1), the kernel task, or a process
  group; the parser drops such rows and every signal path refuses them;
- distinguish privileged processes from launchd domains: root ownership alone
  cannot identify the system daemon, because a login-session PanGPS can elevate
  via setuid; readiness, automatic-disconnect gating, and final Keep Off
  verification bind PanGPS to the fixed current-user `pangps` or system `pangpsd`
  job PID and kernel product path. A complete job listing with state but no
  top-level PID establishes that no service process is running; it does not
  establish that the job is unloaded or disabled. Unknown attribution fails
  without opening the vendor UI or requesting Accessibility;
- require a separate, explicit Force Stop confirmation for `SIGKILL`; preset
  Quit, Close, and Keep Off escalate to `SIGKILL` only after a disclosed
  graceful window (3 seconds) with the identity still present;
- require current-user ownership and an executable directory for every scoped
  termination; there is no name-only termination entry point;
- bind queued prompts and batch reports to immutable captured targets. Prompt
  alerts show the PID and use a new presentation identity when the queue head
  changes; actions from a retired alert cannot claim the replacement prompt.
- require enabled automatic-stop authority to include a trusted executable path
  and match that path again in the final inventory immediately before signal;
- limit Prompt, Auto Stop, and Log Only candidates to current-user processes,
  excluding TaskScope and unsignalable PIDs;
- wait at least one engine cadence on a monotonic clock before the single
  automatic retry, retaining its budget across edits that remain enabled,
  Auto Stop, and matching. An edit still revokes captured pre-signal authority;
- never downgrade a path-backed saved selection to legacy command/name matching;
- bind Activity Monitor handoff to captured UTC start time and kernel executable
  path using local identity reads that support visible processes regardless of
  owner; verify before opening, every selection retry, and after asynchronous
  selection before reporting success. Missing/changed evidence cannot authorize
  a successful handoff.

### Watched presets and imported configuration

A custom preset contains an app path, process names, and optional user
launch-agent labels and plist paths. These values can name real local resources
even though the format does not contain a general-purpose shell command. The
immutable built-in GlobalProtect definition additionally contains fixed
protected-process and system-daemon fields; a custom preset cannot add or alter
them.

Required invariants:

- scope main/helper detection and the Watched filter to the current user, with
  main executables in Contents/MacOS and helpers in Contents, preserving
  protected-service classification across users for display;
- validate every quick-preset process against the resulting main/helper name,
  owner, and executable-directory boundaries before saving;
- importing parses and validates data but performs no lifecycle action;
- bound imported file size, recognize an explicit archive schema version, and
  show every lifecycle field plus rejection reason before import is committed;
- require absolute `.app` and `.plist` paths and valid non-empty labels/names;
- reject duplicate identities, invalid mappings, and any privileged daemon
  fields on a noncanonical preset;
- require the built-in GlobalProtect identity and all of its privileged fields
  to match the fixed canonical definition exactly;
- present custom configured fields for review before destructive use;
- construct fixed tool invocations without evaluating a preset value as shell
  source;
- treat the built-in GlobalProtect preset as version-specific configuration,
  not authority to alter arbitrary protected processes;
- keep protected process names out of the normal killable-name set.

Keep Off polling is triggered only by current-user main/helper processes.
Preserved PanGPS services, including non-root session instances, do not trigger
enforcement or count as failed background session stops. Startup enforcement
disables both fixed user jobs, unloads only `pangpa`, and preserves `pangps`.
Unchanged background failures do not republish reports, replace status messages,
or duplicate diagnostics. PanGPS is never signalled directly.

Residual risk: a syntactically valid custom preset can intentionally point at
the wrong local app or user launch agent. The mandatory import preview exposes
those fields but cannot decide whether the user intended them, so users must
still trust and inspect the source. This risk cannot create a custom privileged
system-daemon operation.

### Privileged GlobalProtect service control

Only the immutable built-in GlobalProtect identity can disable/unload, enable,
or bootstrap the fixed system `pangpsd` daemon with macOS administrator
approval. Custom presets cannot configure this path. Explicit Keep Off and the
built-in preset's Quit All disconnect an active VPN before stopping services;
their confirmation discloses the persistent stop and restoration path.

Required invariants:

- only explicit in-app Keep Off / Apply Keep Off, GlobalProtect Quit All, or the
  separately confirmed Stop Services Anyway recovery may request a system stop;
  background enforcement and startup may verify system state but never prompt
  or mutate it. Open, toggle-off, and Open Watched App may request fixed system
  enable/bootstrap when the installed layout requires it;
- automatic disconnect uses Accessibility only for the fixed GlobalProtect
  executable, rechecking its kernel path before inspection/actions. Only the
  normal Disconnect control is pressed; credentials and management challenges
  are never filled. The vendor app is brought forward to reveal its controls;
  a lost popover gets bounded retries. Unknown state, denial, timeout, or a
  failed press aborts the normal attempt before writing new Keep Off intent or
  changing launch jobs. AX reads run on a
  bounded worker queue. Five consecutive disconnected observations precede
  shutdown; Connected, busy, or unavailable resets the streak. Up to 60
  observations with 0.5-second waits give about 30 seconds of observation time
  plus reads, inside a 90-second overall deadline that also bounds AX requests;
  timeouts leave services running.
  An Error tooltip counts as disconnected only with the same vendor window's
  Connection Failed text, enabled Connect control, and no Disconnect control;
  Error alone, contradictory controls, and unreadable state still abort;
- after a failed explicit disconnect, **Stop Services Anyway** offers a separate
  in-app confirmation that discloses interruption and stale VPN DNS risk, with
  Open as the recovery path. It uses the same fixed service operations and
  administrator authorization, but skips the connection-state prerequisite.
  The recovery is bound to the current failure by a one-use in-memory ID,
  checked inside the mutation gate. Retry and Open (including toggle-off)
  invalidate older failures. No URL, Shortcut, background tick, or stored preference
  can authorize this exception;
- validate the complete built-in identity and fixed job fields before privileged
  commands; require the installed matching plist before introducing a disable
  override so the restore path remains available;
- disable before bootout so launchd cannot immediately respawn the service;
- check both the disabled override and absence of the loaded job after stopping;
  after a successful administrator stop, allow up to 30 seconds for shutdown,
  with probe timeouts bounded by the remaining deadline. Denied, cancelled,
  timed-out, or unknown reads cannot establish success;
- enable before bootstrap; Open restores the installed session `pangps` job
  before its UI, checking the launchd PID, current-user/root ownership, and a
  fresh kernel executable path in the fixed product directories; only layouts
  without this agent use the system daemon path;
- do not force-restart a newly bootstrapped user job with `kickstart -k`, or
  directly signal PanGPS. A loaded service is left running;
- when a valid installed session agent supplies the VPN service, Open and
  toggle-off preserve an existing disable override on the separate system
  daemon. This avoids privilege requests by avoiding the unnecessary system
  mutation; it installs no helper, stores no credentials, and changes no
  authorization policy. On session layouts, Keep Off changes the system override
  only after verifying the daemon is unloaded; a loaded or unknown daemon is
  preserved and reported as an incomplete stop. Missing session agents retain
  the administrator path;
- turning Keep Off off uses the same full restoration command as Open;
- Open restarts an orphaned GlobalProtect UI only when a fresh inventory shows
  that UI running without any PanGPS service. Recovery unloads only the fixed
  `pangpa` UI job and verifies the old UI is gone before restoration. It never
  unloads `pangps` or the system daemon to recover a window. A healthy running
  service and UI are preserved;
- before bootstrapping an unloaded `pangpa` job, check a fresh inventory and
  current-user ownership plus kernel executable path for a directly opened
  GlobalProtect UI. Preserve that UI instead of starting a duplicate; unknown
  inventory fails without launching;
- report cancellation and partial failures, retaining requested intent until
  user-agent restoration succeeds; show a running system service instead of an
  off badge. Polling cancellation skips background reports and failure retention;
- bound service readiness by a monotonic 15-second deadline, including probe
  time and inventory reads, and cap each command timeout by remaining time;
- escape command arguments, retain no credentials, and never remove, rename,
  or rewrite vendor files;
- changes to the fixed system job use launchd, never arbitrary elevated process
  signaling or custom/imported system commands.

Residual risk: macOS authorization elevates the fixed commands, and changing a
VPN service may affect network availability. Vendor files remain controlled by
the installer/system administrator. Management software can reject or undo a
change; report this instead of bypassing policy. VPN connectivity and system
extensions are outside the process/launchd checks and require live validation.

### Persistent GlobalProtect suppression

Keep Off stores intent in TaskScope and disabled overrides in launchd's user and
system databases. Existing user-only intent does not authorize privileged
background operations after upgrade; Apply Keep Off requests the expanded
operation explicitly. Open and toggle-off are the explicit restoration paths.

Background enforcement persistently disables both fixed current-user jobs but
unloads only `pangpa`. Any loaded `pangps` is preserved because polling does not
verify a disconnected tunnel. It re-checks intent inside the operation gate so queued
enforcement cannot undo Open. It never repeatedly prompts for system approval
or automatically fights a system service restored by management. Automatic
disconnect UI control runs only during an explicit action, never polling. The UI shows
that service running and offers a confirmed explicit action; a loaded separate
system daemon on a session layout remains preserved even on retry. No destructive
URL route is added; ordinary process stop and Auto Stop retain their existing boundaries.

### URL, Shortcut, and login automation

Any local app, webpage handler, or document can attempt to open a custom URL.
App Intents can be invoked through user-configured Shortcuts or directly through
Siri, Spotlight, and App Shortcuts without prior configuration.

Required invariants:

- accept only `taskscope://refresh` through the custom URL scheme;
- reject URL requests to open/stop presets or quit TaskScope;
- queue a cold-launch refresh without activating unnecessary UI;
- discard cancelled queued commands before dispatch and carry cancellation into
  a command waiting for the process-operation gate; cancelling one submission
  must not cancel its neighbors or imply that completed mutations were undone;
- finish an admitted preset Stop despite caller cancellation; keep Open readiness
  cancellable and report possible prior changes without retaining cancellation
  as an inventory or lifecycle failure;
- route App Intent actions through the same identity validation and truthful
  result reporting as the app; Stop Watched App must request system confirmation
  naming the app before submitting a stop command, including direct App Shortcuts;
- keep cold intent launches in the background, including entity queries and
  confirmation; late intent signals suppress a launch with no interactive
  activation or explicit window request, without demoting an app already in use;
- do not treat local/development signing as proof of production artifact
  identity;
- make Launch at Login optional and recover visibly from macOS approval states;
  provide an explicit unregister action in Requires Approval and Unavailable
  states and report removal errors.

### Preferences, exports, and recovery

Settings > Health has a separate read-only probe surface with no lifecycle,
permission-request, registration, or preference writer. It checks local signing
integrity with network access disabled, bounded regular-file metadata read
through symlink targets with descriptor type checks and nonblocking opens, and
running/on-disk identity without reporting signature integrity as notarization,
distribution trust, or Shortcuts execution. Unknown access remains unverified;
inaccessible files do not become missing files. Optional paths and corrupt-store
fallbacks retain their distinct meaning. Expired observations and canceled
collections cannot authorize recovery. Recovery only navigates to verified local
destinations, rechecks the target on click, and never silently resets TCC,
registers login items, reinstalls/re-signs an app, or executes a Shortcut.
Results stay in memory and do not extend the support export schema.

Support diagnostics are a separate export boundary from preset backups. The
report model accepts fixed status/action/reason categories, booleans, counts,
timestamps, and strictly numeric version metadata. Schema version 2 encodes
unreadable saved Keep Off and notification settings as `null`, never default or
unsaved in-memory booleans. Shipped lifecycle entry points record `open`,
`quitApp`, `quitHelpers`, `close`, or `keepOff`; automatic disconnect failure
uses `disconnectFailed`. Toggle-off maps to `open`, GlobalProtect Quit All and
Stop Services Anyway to `keepOff`, and Shortcuts Stop to `close`.
It never serializes raw presets, command results, inventory, logs, or error strings. Custom preset UUIDs
are used only for in-memory filtering and replaced with a report-local reference;
only a verified built-in identity receives the fixed GlobalProtect kind.
Lifecycle failure retention is bounded to 20 session entries and raw job data is
reduced to counts at capture. Collection performs read-only permission/file/job
checks without administrator prompts or lifecycle mutation. The entire JSON is
previewed before explicit copy/save, using the same immutable byte buffer.
Tests exercise adversarial names, commands, paths, errors, metadata, identity
spoofing, retention, and equality of preview/file contents. This does not redact
ordinary lifecycle sheets, preset exports, picker screenshots, or local logs.

Standard preferences store settings, preset/rule data, saved process matching
fields, event history, and recovery backups. They are local but not encrypted
or protected from the current user.

Required invariants:

- detect an existing same-user, same-bundle instance before shared-store writes,
  command handling, hotkey registration, or background enforcement; request a
  reopen of its window and terminate the duplicate;
- isolate startup-verification stores and onboarding in fresh volatile defaults
  without reading/changing normal preferences or enforcing Keep Off;
- decode versioned data defensively; recover valid events individually, preserve
  mixed payloads in rejectedMigrationBackup slots, and require explicit reset
  before committing recovered events or resuming durable logging;
- preserve unknown stored JSON fields and non-string event outcomes on retained
  entries, including automatic preset normalization and event trimming;
- disable and lock rules with unknown fields rather than enforce a rule whose
  newer restrictions are not understood;
- keep normalized settings fallbacks in memory without replacing newer stored
  values during unrelated saves;
- preserve unreadable payloads instead of overwriting them with defaults,
  including binary property-list backups of wrong-type values and non-dictionary
  hotkey settings. Keep primary values read-only until explicit reset;
- publish no default App Intents watched-app targets when stored preset data is
  unreadable, including wrong-type property-list values;
- retain original partially rejected presets/rules/selections/events in
  `.rejectedMigrationBackup` slots alongside unreadable `.corruptBackup` slots;
  each family has ten non-overwriting slots (base suffix, `.2` through `.10);
- recover valid saved selections independently, preserve their unknown fields,
  and require explicit reset to commit recovered entries;
- block persistence that would silently destroy unreadable primary data;
- refuse all Keep Off intent writers while settings are unreadable, including
  GlobalProtect Quit All and confirmed Stop Services Anyway;
- refuse built-in preset deletion when settings recovery makes Keep Off unknown,
  Keep Off is enabled, or an explicit action is queued/running; recheck preset
  existence and settings writability after disconnect before writing intent
  or disabling services;
- preserve optional launch-job requirements through normalization and migration
  so valid built-in presets round-trip without entering corruption recovery;
- require an explicit destructive reset to resume writes;
- never export a fallback empty collection as if it were a valid backup;
- keep auto-stop history bounded and live chart samples in memory;
- document that changing the bundle identifier changes the preference domain
  and requires a tested migration or an explicit data-loss warning.

### Logs, notifications, and reports

Process and preset names can identify a person, organization, or sensitive
application even when they never leave the Mac.

Required invariants:

- no analytics or automatic diagnostic upload;
- do not log full process command lines or imported lifecycle payloads;
- use private log interpolation unless a field is demonstrably nonsensitive;
- notify only after opt-in and avoid false transitions during reconfiguration;
  re-baseline when preset identities, app paths, process-name assignments, or
  notification settings change;
- tell users to sanitize screenshots, logs, exports, and bug reports.

### Build and distribution

The local build/install scripts create a same-machine bundle using an Apple
Development identity when available or ad-hoc signing otherwise. They build the
current architecture and do not notarize. The separate credential-gated release
pipeline can produce a Developer ID-signed, hardened, arm64, notarized artifact,
but only when its real Apple credentials and automated checks succeed.

Required invariants:

- keep bundle identifier, version, build, architecture, and signature claims
  consistent with the artifact;
- verify the bundle after copying and installation, including identifier,
  version, and build;
- hold the packaging lock throughout static/startup verification and through
  validation and copying for installation;
- check for running same-identifier bundles before opening or debugging another
  path; refuse known conflicts without stopping that other copy;
- replace an installed bundle transactionally and restore it on failure;
- do not publish a local staged app as a production binary;
- require Developer ID signing, hardened runtime review, notarization, stapling,
  checksums, and clean-machine verification before claiming a public binary;
- treat a production bundle-ID change as a data/permission migration event.

## Abuse cases and expected response

| Abuse case | Expected response |
| --- | --- |
| Browser opens `taskscope://stop/...` | Reject without a process action. |
| PID exits and is reused after confirmation | Identity revalidation prevents the signal and reports the changed target. |
| Process changes executable after confirmation | Executable-path identity revalidation prevents the signal. |
| Process inventory fails | Report verification failure; do not claim stopped or stale. |
| Imported custom preset contains a relative plist path or any system-daemon job | Reject that preset without executing it. |
| Valid-looking custom preset points at an unintended user launch agent | Show the field and later-operation summary before import; require the user to reject an unintended path. |
| Preferences contain malformed JSON or a wrong property-list type | Preserve backup, enter read-only recovery state, require explicit reset. |
| Privileged bootstrap fails or is denied | Report failure and leave the managed files intact. |
| Ad-hoc bundle is presented as a production binary | Release gate rejects the claim and artifact. |

## Security review checklist

For every release and trust-boundary change:

1. Add a regression test that fails before the security fix.
2. Run the complete gate in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
3. Exercise signals only against disposable controlled processes.
4. Test missing, malformed, denied, partial-failure, cancellation, and PID-reuse
   paths.
5. Inspect imported-data handling and every shell/AppleScript argument boundary.
6. Review logs, notifications, exports, and public error text for private data.
7. Verify actual artifact architecture and signing/notarization state.
8. Update this document, [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md), and the changelog.

Vulnerabilities should be reported according to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
