# GlobalProtect behavior and recovery

TaskScope's built-in preset targets fixed GlobalProtect processes and launchd
jobs. Product layouts and management policies vary. The [compatibility matrix](../GLOBALPROTECT_COMPATIBILITY.md)
records limited observations; lifecycle behavior across login/reboot and
management policies remains unverified.

## Quit All and explicit Keep Off

**Quit All**, the **Keep GlobalProtect Off** switch, and **Apply Keep Off…** use
the full shutdown path after confirmation. TaskScope attributes PanGPS to the
fixed current-user `pangps` or system `pangpsd` launchd job using the job PID,
ownership, and kernel executable path. Root ownership alone is insufficient:
a session service can run as root through setuid. A complete job listing with
state but no top-level PID establishes that no service process is running, not
that the job is unloaded or disabled. Malformed output remains unknown; unknown
attribution fails before opening the vendor UI or requesting Accessibility.

When needed, TaskScope requests Accessibility to press the fixed vendor app's
Disconnect control and waits for five consecutive disconnected observations.
A Connected, busy, or unreadable observation resets that streak. The current
adapter recognizes English status/control labels. **Not Connected** is idle;
**Error** is idle only with **Connection Failed**, an enabled **Connect**, and
no **Disconnect** in the same vendor window. Error alone is insufficient.
TaskScope never enters credentials or answers policy challenges.

The observation window is about 30 seconds: up to 60 observations with waits of
0.5 seconds between them, plus observation work. A 90-second overall deadline
also bounds Accessibility requests. Opening or revealing controls and slow
reads can consume that deadline; unreadable state can fail sooner. A timeout,
unavailable control, permission failure, or unverifiable disconnect leaves
services running without recording new Keep Off intent or changing launch jobs.

After verified disconnect, TaskScope records Keep Off intent, persistently
disables the known per-user jobs, unloads them, and stops eligible app/helper
processes. The fixed system `pangpsd` daemon can be disabled then booted out
with macOS administrator approval. After successful authorization, shutdown
verification allows up to 30 seconds with bounded probes. Unknown reads and
partial failures are reported, never treated as proof of an off state. Once the
privileged script reports that its disable step succeeded, that verification
decides the result, not bootout's exit status. Cancelled or denied approval and
a failed disable are reported after one inspection, without waiting.

On session-agent installations, a loaded or uninspectable separate system
daemon and its override are preserved and the stop is incomplete. Retrying
Apply Keep Off does not override that policy. Consult the organization managing
the Mac. Only an already-unloaded system daemon can receive the disable override
on that layout, with a matching installed plist and administrator approval.
PanGPS is never signalled directly, and vendor files and VPN configuration are
never removed or rewritten.

A full stop from the menu bar opens the regular TaskScope window before vendor
UI control; progress and the complete result remain visible. The result window
returns to the front after success or failure.

## Failed disconnect recovery

After a failed explicit disconnect, **Stop Services Anyway…** offers a separate
confirmation. It skips the idle-state prerequisite and uses the same fixed
service operations and administrator authorization. It can interrupt internet
access or leave stale VPN DNS. The exception is tied to a one-use, in-memory
failure identifier; a new attempt, Open, or app restart clears it. URLs,
Shortcuts, background ticks, and stored preferences cannot authorize it.

If DNS fails after stopping, choose **Open**, leave the VPN disconnected, and
verify normal internet access before retrying Keep Off. Earlier observations on
GlobalProtect 6.3.3-1121 found stale DNS even after the client displayed
Disconnected; Open restored DNS without reconnecting, and a subsequent idle stop
preserved public DNS/HTTPS. Later [automatic Quit All observations](../Evidence/GlobalProtect/2026-09-28-quit-all.md)
preserved public access in two connected-to-off cycles on the recorded
configuration. These results are not a guarantee. TaskScope does not rewrite
DNS, routes, or vendor settings as a workaround.

## Open and turning Keep Off off

Both actions perform full restoration of the required VPN service and app.
Open clears required disable overrides even without saved Keep Off intent; if
the app bundle is missing, it attempts override recovery and reports that
nothing could be opened. Failed user-job restoration retains Keep Off intent.

When a valid `pangps` session agent is installed, Open restores and verifies it
before opening the app. Otherwise it enables/bootstraps the fixed system daemon
with administrator approval. Open never restarts a loaded daemon or force-restarts
a newly bootstrapped user job. Healthy unchanged Open reports no restoration and
shows no service sheet. Malformed or mismatched session plists fail visibly.

Session installations preserve the separate system daemon's disable override.
After the initial approved full stop, subsequent cycles need no administrator
prompt unless system state or the installed layout changes. TaskScope stores
no password, installs no elevated helper, and makes no authorization exception.
This retained override needs explicit cleanup during [uninstall](../SUPPORT.md#uninstall-and-erase-local-data).

If the UI is stuck retrieving portal configuration without PanGPS, Open closes
that orphaned UI, verifies it is gone, restores the service, and starts one UI.
It does not unload a VPN service to recover a window or bootstrap a duplicate
interface over an existing healthy one. Use the organization/IT installer or
support path if the protected service cannot be restored.

## Ordinary Quit and background enforcement

Quit App, Quit Helpers, and Shortcuts Stop do not disconnect. For GlobalProtect,
they can unload only the `pangpa` interface agent, preserving the `pangps`
session VPN service and system daemon. Quit Helpers also preserves an agent
running the main process. Stopping a session VPN service under a connected
tunnel can leave DNS unusable, so use the full explicit path when intended.

Background Keep Off runs at startup and when current-user main/helper processes
return. It disables both fixed user jobs but unloads only `pangpa`, preserving
a loaded `pangps`. A preserved PanGPS service is not a polling trigger or a
failed background session stop. Background checks never request administrator
approval or change system services. Service state and Apply Keep Off remain
visible; unchanged failures do not repeatedly replace the footer, publish
reports, or append diagnostics. User-job and system-state failures can produce
reports. Older saved intent never authorizes a background privileged stop.

## Settings recovery and preset deletion

Unreadable settings disable Quit All, Apply Keep Off, the Keep Off switch, and
Stop Services Anyway with a reset-settings explanation. Preserve the recovery
backup and use **Settings > General > Reset Settings After Backup** before
changing Keep Off. Quit App and Quit Helpers remain available.

The built-in preset cannot be deleted while Keep Off is enabled, an explicit
Keep Off action is queued or running, or settings are unreadable. The action
rechecks preset existence and settings writability after disconnect before
recording intent or changing services; stale confirmations cannot orphan overrides.

## Compatibility and support

**Compatibility Self-Check** reads known installation, launchd, and process
state without changing lifecycle state. Preview, copy, or export the redacted
summary. See [collection instructions](../SUPPORT.md#collect-globalprotect-compatibility-evidence)
and [compatibility evidence](../GLOBALPROTECT_COMPATIBILITY.md).

An off result concerns known processes and launchd jobs. It does not verify VPN
health, remove system extensions, certify policy compatibility, or discover
relocated jobs. Fast User Switching and vendor UI routing between sessions
still require live validation. Management can reject or reverse changes;
TaskScope reports failure and does not bypass policy.
