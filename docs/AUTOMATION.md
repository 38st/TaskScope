## Refresh-only URL contract

The packaged app registers the `taskscope` URL scheme. Another local app,
document, or browser can open a URL, so the sole accepted route is:

```bash
open "taskscope://refresh"
```

It refreshes watched-app status. Paths, credentials, ports, query parameters,
and fragments are rejected, as are all other routes, including preset Open,
preset Stop, and application Quit. A cold-launch refresh queues until the
command runtime is ready without requiring a window.

Destructive lifecycle actions require in-app interaction or **Stop Watched App**
with system confirmation. App Shortcuts can be invoked through Siri or Spotlight
without prior configuration; configuration is not the confirmation boundary.
Changes to the URL contract require threat-model review and regression coverage.

## Shortcuts

Install and launch a properly signed packaged app to discover **Refresh
TaskScope**, **Open Watched App**, and **Stop Watched App**. Open and Stop use a
user-selected entity from stored presets and share the app's lifecycle result
reporting. Stop requests confirmation naming that app before stopping eligible
watched processes, including direct App Shortcut invocation.

Cold intent launches, including entity pickers and confirmation, stay in the
background without opening a window or leaving a Dock icon. Late intent signals
suppress a launch that has had no interactive activation or explicit window
request; an app already in use is not demoted. Queued cancelled commands are
rejected independently. An admitted preset Stop completes despite caller
cancellation; Open readiness remains cancellable and reports possible prior
changes. See [process behavior](USING_TASKSCOPE.md#process-actions-and-observations).

Ad-hoc signing cannot execute App Intents even if metadata verifies. Live
Shortcuts discovery and execution require testing with an eligible signature.

## Administrator operations

Only the immutable built-in GlobalProtect definition has privileged operations:

- Explicit in-app Keep Off / Apply Keep Off, GlobalProtect Quit All, and the
  separately confirmed Stop Services Anyway can disable then boot out the fixed
  `system/com.paloaltonetworks.gp.pangpsd` job, subject to the installed layout.
- Open, turning Keep Off off, and **Open Watched App** can enable/bootstrap that
  fixed daemon when the layout requires it. A loaded daemon is never restarted.

These operations use the macOS administrator prompt. URLs and background
enforcement never request privileges. Shortcuts Stop uses user-process scope:
for GlobalProtect it can unload only `pangpa`, preserving the `pangps` session
VPN service and the system daemon. Custom presets cannot introduce privileged
jobs. Read [GlobalProtect](GLOBALPROTECT.md) and the [threat model](../THREAT_MODEL.md)
for attribution, recovery, and layout limits.
